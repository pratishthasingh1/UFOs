## Overview:
A data journalist reports her hometown is famous for UFO sightings. She needs to put together a website to display the sightings that occured in January 2010. A data analyst was put to work by first making an webpage using JavaScript and HTML, and then inputing the datafile she received onto a table, which users can then make queries on, if desired. They can look up cities, state, country, shape, or date to search for sightings. 

## Results: 
In the file the Dana received, there were many sightings. If Dana (or any user who has access to the webpage) wanted to see a specific sighting, they can use the filter that is on the webpage to find the information on it quicker. For instance, someone can pick the city and state and multiple UFO sightings may be returned. In order to narrow it down, they can input the date or shape to narrow it down even further. 

## Summary: 
A drawback is the data is fairly limited, I would recommend using data not only from the file she received, but from all over the internet (using scraping)
Right now, users have to input the data, this may lead to errors as capitalization may cause the user to not get results that they want, unknowingly. I would suggest to put in a drop down option so users can pick and see all their options.
I would also recommend possibly adding a link to the original documentation that talks about the sighting so users can make their own conclusions.
